# Novoenzyme Thermo Stability Prediction - Sequence Generation 🧬🔥

The Novoenzyme Thermo Stability Prediction - Sequence Generation is a groundbreaking Python-based tool designed to revolutionize the prediction of enzyme thermal stability and the generation of novel enzyme sequences with enhanced stability. Let's dive into the world of biotechnology and computational magic! ✨

## Competition Description 🌐

Novozymes, the biotech powerhouse, is on a mission to find, optimize, and revolutionize enzymes for a multitude of industries, from laundry detergents to biofuels. Enzymes play a pivotal role in reducing environmental impact and enhancing efficiency across various sectors. However, many enzymes struggle with stability, limiting their performance and potential.

This competition invites you to develop a model that predicts and ranks the thermostability of enzyme variants. Your predictions are based on experimental melting temperature data obtained from Novozymes' high throughput screening lab. With access to data from previous scientific publications, you'll be handling stability data that spans from natural sequences to engineered ones with mutations. Success in this competition promises to advance the understanding of protein stability, ultimately leading to the design of novel and useful proteins more rapidly and cost-effectively.

## Features 🚀

**Thermal Stability Prediction**: Our tool harnesses the power of advanced machine learning models trained on extensive datasets to predict the thermal stability of enzymes. Simply input the amino acid sequence of an enzyme, and you'll receive a predicted thermal stability score.

**Sequence Generation**: But that's not all! Using the predicted thermal stability scores, our tool can generate brand-new enzyme sequences with improved stability. It employs generative models and evolutionary algorithms to explore the sequence space, seeking out sequences likely to exhibit enhanced thermal stability.

**User-Friendly Interface**: We've made it easy! The tool offers a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that guides you through inputting enzyme sequences, predicting their thermal stability, and generating fresh sequences. It's as straightforward as following clear instructions and prompts.

**Customization**: Tweak it your way! The tool allows customization of various parameters such as generation strategy, population size, and evolutionary operators, so you can fine-tune the sequence generation process to match your specific needs.
