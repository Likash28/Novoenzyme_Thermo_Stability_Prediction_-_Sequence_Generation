# Novoenzyme_Thermo_Stability_Prediction_-_Sequence_Generation


The Novoenzyme Thermo Stability Prediction - Sequence Generation is a Python-based tool developed to predict the thermal stability of enzymes and generate new enzyme sequences with improved stability. This tool combines machine learning techniques and sequence generation algorithms to provide accurate predictions and generate novel enzyme variants.

# Features:

Thermal Stability Prediction: The tool employs advanced machine learning models trained on large datasets to predict the thermal stability of enzymes. It takes the amino acid sequence of an enzyme as input and provides a predicted thermal stability score.

Sequence Generation: Using the predicted thermal stability scores, the tool can generate new enzyme sequences with improved stability. It employs generative models and evolutionary algorithms to explore the sequence space and identify sequences that are likely to have enhanced thermal stability.

User-Friendly Interface: The tool offers a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that makes it easy to input enzyme sequences, predict their thermal stability, and generate new sequences. It provides clear instructions and prompts for smooth operation.

Customization: The tool allows users to customize various parameters such as generation strategy, population size, and evolutionary operators, enabling them to fine-tune the sequence generation process according to their specific requirements.

Performance Evaluation: The tool provides a comprehensive performance evaluation, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the reliability of the thermal stability predictions.

Data Visualization: It offers data visualization capabilities to analyze and interpret the results. Users can generate plots and charts to visualize the distribution of predicted stability scores, compare different sequences, and track the progress of sequence generation.
